## Final Resolution Summary - September 14, 2025

### Issue Identification and Resolution
Through comprehensive log analysis, the final critical issue was identified and resolved:

**Problem**: IPC cloning errors occurring when forwarding logs from renderer to main process
- Error: "An object could not be cloned" in IPC communication
- Caused by complex objects with circular references being transmitted via IPC

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Data Sanitization System** - Added comprehensive `sanitizeForIPC()` method to `utils/renderer-logger.js`
2. **Type-Specific Handling** - Handles functions, dates, errors, arrays, and objects safely
3. **Depth and Property Limiting** - Prevents infinite recursion and oversized objects
4. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Graceful degradation for unserializable data

**Technical Details**:
- **File Modified**: `utils/renderer-logger.js:26-54` and `utils/renderer-logger.js:62`
- **Method Added**: `sanitizeForIPC(obj, depth = 0)` with comprehensive type checking
- **Integration**: Applied sanitization in `forwardToMain()` method for all IPC transmissions
- **Result**: Complete elimination of IPC cloning errors, verified through testing

### Application Status
The Easy Debug application is now fully operational with:
- ✅ Zero runtime errors
- ✅ Complete UI functionality
- ✅ Working terminal integration
- ✅ Functional project management
- ✅ Error-free IPC communication
- ✅ Enterprise-grade logging system
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### Development Completion
All planned development phases (1-8) have been successfully completed with comprehensive testing, error resolution, and enterprise-grade logging implementation. The application is ready for production deployment across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
