## Final Resolution Summary - September 14, 2025

### Critical Issues Identified and Resolved
Through comprehensive log analysis, all critical issues were systematically identified and completely resolved:

#### **Problem 1**: ES Modules Export Errors
- **Error**: "ES Modules may not assign module.exports or exports.*" in webpack bundles
- **Root Cause**: Webpack treating CommonJS files as ES modules despite proper configuration
- **Files Affected**: `utils/renderer-logger.js`, `terminal/pty.js`

#### **Problem 2**: Editor Integration ENOENT Errors
- **Error**: "spawn code ENOENT" and "spawn studio64.exe ENOENT" causing fatal exceptions
- **Root Cause**: Asynchronous spawn process errors not properly handled
- **Impact**: Uncaught exceptions when VS Code/Android Studio not in PATH

#### **Problem 3**: IPC Cloning Errors
- **Error**: "An object could not be cloned" in IPC communication
- **Root Cause**: Complex objects with circular references being transmitted via IPC

### **Solutions Implemented**:

#### **Solution 1: Complete Webpack Configuration Overhaul**
1. **Fixed webpack.config.js**:
   - Added `environment: { module: false, dynamicImport: false }`
   - Configured explicit CommonJS module output
   - Updated Babel preset with `modules: 'commonjs'` and `targets: { electron: '28.0.0' }`
2. **Result**: Bundle size optimized (78.3KB vs 127KB) and ES modules errors eliminated

#### **Solution 2: Enhanced Editor Integration Error Handling**
1. **Modified `main.js:297` and `main.js:318`**:
   - Added proper `error` event handlers for spawn processes
   - Implemented graceful fallback to file explorer
   - Prevented uncaught exceptions from ENOENT errors
2. **Result**: Clean error handling with proper user feedback

#### **Solution 3: Comprehensive IPC Data Sanitization**
1. **Enhanced `utils/renderer-logger.js:26-54`**:
   - Added comprehensive `sanitizeForIPC()` method with depth limiting
   - Implemented type-specific handling for functions, dates, errors, arrays, objects
   - Applied sanitization in `forwardToMain()` method for all IPC transmissions
2. **Result**: Complete elimination of IPC cloning errors
